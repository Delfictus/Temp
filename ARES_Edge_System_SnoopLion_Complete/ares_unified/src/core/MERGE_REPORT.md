   - Pimpl pattern implementations

### CUDA Implementations (ares_unified/src/core/cuda/)

   - Original kernels from repo1_1onlyadvance
   - Added optimized homomorphic operations
   - Lock-free Q-learning kernels
   - Chaos detection kernels
   - C-style wrapper functions for external linkage

## Key Features Integrated

### From repo1_1onlyadvance:
- Quantum-resilient core with post-quantum cryptography
- CUDA kernels for quantum operations
- Lock-free Q-learning implementation
- EM spectrum analysis and network discovery
- Byzantine consensus with deterministic ordering

### From repo2_delfictus:
- Neuromorphic core with SIMD optimizations
- Multiple neuron models (LIF, AdEx, EM Sensor, Chaos Detector)
- Synaptic models with STDP
- Brian2 integration support

### New Additions:
- Unified ARES Core interface
- Component-based architecture
- Proper separation of interface and implementation
- Core utilities for common operations
- C++20 compliance with proper namespace structure

## Compilation Requirements
- C++20 standard
- CUDA 12.0+ (optional, for GPU acceleration)
- OpenMP for CPU parallelization
- SIMD intrinsics (AVX2/AVX512 on x86_64)
- Open Quantum Safe library (optional, for post-quantum crypto)

## Namespace Structure
```
ares::
  core::           // Core utilities and interfaces
  quantum::        // Quantum-resilient components
  neuromorphic::   // Neuromorphic processing
```

## Integration Notes

### Include Path Updates
All files have been updated to use relative include paths matching the new structure:
- `#include "../include/header.h"` for internal headers
- System headers remain unchanged

### Platform Detection
- Uses `ARES_CUDA_AVAILABLE` macro for CUDA code
- Provides CPU fallbacks for all GPU operations
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained

### Thread Safety
- Lock-free data structures for concurrent access
- Atomic operations for Q-learning updates
- Mutex protection where necessary (e.g., network discovery)

## Issues Resolved

1. **Namespace Conflicts**: Updated from `ares::quantum` to proper nested namespaces
2. **CUDA Compatibility**: Fixed __uint128_t usage (not available in CUDA)
3. **Include Dependencies**: Proper header organization with forward declarations
4. **Template Instantiations**: Explicit instantiations in separate implementation file

## Recommendations

1. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests needed for:
   - Lock-free Q-learning operations
   - Post-quantum cryptography functions
   - Neuromorphic network simulations

2. **Performance**: Profile and optimize:
   - CUDA kernel launch configurations
   - SIMD operations on different architectures
   - Memory transfer overhead between CPU/GPU

3. **Security**: Audit implementation of:
   - Secure memory erasure
   - Constant-time cryptographic operations
   - Network access controls

4. **Documentation**: Add detailed API documentation for:
   - Component lifecycle management
   - Integration examples
   - Performance tuning guidelines

## Next Steps

1. Integrate remaining modules (backscatter, cew, etc.)
2. Create CMake build configuration
3. Implement unit tests
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Create integration examples
