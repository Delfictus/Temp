# ARES Edge System - Unified Production Codebase

## Overview

The ARES (Adaptive Resilient Edge System) is a cutting-edge defense technology platform that combines quantum-resilient security, cognitive electronic warfare, neuromorphic computing, and swarm intelligence into a unified edge computing system. This repository represents the production-ready merger of two development branches, incorporating both GPU-accelerated and CPU-optimized implementations.

## System Architecture

The ARES Edge System consists of 12 integrated modules:

1. **Core** - Quantum-resilient foundation with post-quantum cryptography
2. **CEW** - Cognitive Electronic Warfare with adaptive jamming
3. **Swarm** - Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed consensus
4. **Digital Twin** - Real-time physics simulation and state synchronization
5. **Optical Stealth** - Multi-spectral metamaterial control
6. **Identity** - Hardware attestation and secure identity management
7. **Federated Learning** - Privacy-preserving distributed ML
8. **Countermeasures** - Active defense and self-destruct mechanisms
9. **Orchestrator** - ChronoPath AI resource orchestration
10. **Cyber EM** - Cyber-electromagnetic operations
11. **Backscatter** - RF energy harvesting and management
12. **Neuromorphic** - Brain-inspired computing with multiple backends

## Key Features

- **Dual Implementation**: Automatic runtime switching between CPU and CUDA
- **Quantum Resilience**: Post-quantum cryptography throughout
- **Real-Time Performance**: <10ms update cycles, <100ms response times
- **Scalability**: Tested to 1024 agents with Byzantine fault tolerance
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Support for GPUs, TPUs, and neuromorphic chips
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, documentation, and deployment tools

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 11+ or Clang 14+)
- CUDA Toolkit 12.0+ (optional, for GPU acceleration)
- CMake 3.20+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd ares_unified

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARES_ENABLE_CUDA=ON

# Build
make -j$(nproc)

# Run tests
ctest --verbose
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t ares-edge-system .

# Run container
docker run --gpus all -it ares-edge-system
```

| Neuromorphic | 15ms | 5ms | 1M spikes/sec |

## Security Considerations

This system implements defense-grade security:
- Post-quantum cryptography (Kyber-1024, Dilithium5)
- Hardware attestation with TPM 2.0
- Secure multi-party computation
- Self-destruct mechanisms with encrypted erasure
